4 elements of embedded linux

Toolchain
bootloader
kernel
rootfilesystem
+
one more element can be doman specific application


Input data -> description of what we want (kernel configuration, Hardware type, packages/binaries)

output -> Linux based mebedded products
	(linux kernel, root filesystem, bootloader, device tree)



Linux boot requirement
RBL -> ROM boot loader (very tiny bootloader)
	1- very first piece of code to run on the SoC on power on
	2- written by vendor and stored in ROM during production, can't be changed (source code not availability, very limited functionalities)
	3- major job, load and execute the second stage bootloader from internal storage (SPL/ML0)

SPL -> load the third stage bootloader (U-boot)
	1- driven from U-boot

U-boot -> loading the kernel


buildroot 
	1- build tools - mandatory packages
		1.1- https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement-mandatory

	2- in buildroot directory
		2.1- make menuconfig || make nconfig (curser-based configurator) || make xconfig (new curser-based configurator) || make gconfig
		2.2- For each menu entry in the configuration tool, you can find associated help that describes the purpose of the entry
		2.3- onfiguration tool generates a .config
		2.4- will be read by the top-level Makefile
	3- build
		3.1- type "make"
		3.2- no support for parallel build by def -> "https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#top-level-parallel-build"
		3.3- The make command will generally perform the following steps:
		3.3.1- download source files (as required);
		3.3.2- configure, build and install the cross-compilation toolchain, or simply import an external toolchain;
		3.3.3- configure, build and install selected target packages;
		3.3.4- build a kernel image, if selected;
		3.3.5- build a bootloader image, if selected;
		3.3.6- create a root filesystem in selected formats.
	4- output is stored in a single directory, output/
		4.1- images/ where all the images (kernel image, bootloader and root filesystem images) are stored. These are the files you need to put on your target system
