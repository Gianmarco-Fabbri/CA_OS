# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

We collect here a set of frequently asked questions to support all students.





## If I am enrolled this year, can I participate in the project next year?

No, the project is given only during the first year you are enrolled. Being enrolled does not necessarily mean that you will attend the course; it simply means the course has been added to your career plan.

Bachelor's students who added the course in advance can decide to postpone it to the next year if they communicate it by the end of the first month. If so, they won't be able to give the exam. Otherwise, the course will be considered as attended.

## For the assessments, is it mandatory to be in person, or is it possible to complete them remotely using the Lockdown browser / crownlab?

NO!!!! All exams and assessments are in person. POLITO does not allow remote exams.
