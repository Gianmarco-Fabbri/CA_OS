# Projects  

Projects are designed to apply the concepts learned in class while encouraging students to independently research documentation and acquire new skills beyond the course scope.  

The project will be evaluated based on: 
 
* **Proficiency** in implementing and developing embedded applications  
* **Efficiency** of the implementation  
* **Teamwork and collaboration** skills  
* **Presentation** skills  
* **Individual contributions** to the project  

## Evaluation  

* **Maximum score:** 10  
* **Deadline:** September 30th, 2026  
* **Team evaluation:**  
  * Agree with your teammates on a **submission date**  
  * Presentations may be conducted **online**  
* **One-shot opportunity:**  
  * Projects can only be assigned during the **first academic year** in which you attend the course  
  * If you **skip** the course this year and you do not ask for a project, you **cannot** take the project next year  
  * If you **withdraw** from a team, you **cannot** join another team in later years  
* The project is also an opportunity to **develop teamwork** and collaboration skills.  
  * If conflicts arise, try to resolve them within the group  
  * If not possible, arrange a **meeting with the professor** and the entire team  

> [!caution]  
> If the course is in your academic plan, it will be recorded as **“attended”** at the end of the year, even if you never participated.  
> To **postpone** the course (including the project and exam) to the following year, you must **notify the professor by the end of the second week of the semester**.  

## Teamwork  

* To participate in a project, you must **register** using the online spreadsheet provided by the professor  
* Teams must consist of **3 to 6 students** (at least **4 recommended**)  

## Common Issues  

* All team members must be **present** during the project delivery. Plan ahead and stay committed—**poor performance from one member affects the whole team**.  
* **Withdrawal:** Allowed only if you inform all teammates and the professor **in writing and in due time** → **evaluation = 0**  
* **Disappearance:** If a member abandons the project without notice, the **entire project will be penalized (–2 points)**  
* **Non-delivery:** If the project is not delivered, you must instead **take the exam and pass Part 1.3**
