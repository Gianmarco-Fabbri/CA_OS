# Exercise 3 â€” general questions

**Question 1**: Which scheduling algorithm is most commonly used in hard real-time OS?

* [ ] Round-Robin Scheduling
* [ ] Shortest Job Next (SJN)
* [ ] Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)
* [ ] First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

**Question 2**: What is the main purpose of priority inversion handling in real-time OS?

* [ ] To improve CPU utilization
* [ ] To ensure that low-priority tasks always execute first
* [ ] To prevent a high-priority task from being blocked indefinitely by a lower-priority task
* [ ] To allow all tasks to share equal CPU time

**Question 3:** In a real-time OS, which of the following statements about interrupt latency is true?

* [ ] Interrupt latency is the time taken to process an interrupt completely.
* [ ] Interrupt latency is the time taken from when an interrupt is triggered until it starts execution.
* [ ] Interrupt latency does not impact system performance.
* [ ] real-time OS does not allow interrupts to be preempted.

**Question 4:** What is a hard real-time system?

* [ ] A system where tasks have strict deadlines and missing a deadline can cause system failure
* [ ] A system that prioritizes throughput over deadline constraints
* [ ] A system where tasks execute as soon as possible, without strict timing guarantees
* [ ] A system where the CPU is always fully utilized

**Question 5:** What is the primary purpose of task preemption in an real-time OS?

* [ ] To allow lower-priority tasks to run indefinitely
* [ ] To improve memory usage efficiency
* [ ] To ensure higher-priority tasks execute immediately when needed
* [ ] To prevent the real-time OS from handling multiple tasks at once
