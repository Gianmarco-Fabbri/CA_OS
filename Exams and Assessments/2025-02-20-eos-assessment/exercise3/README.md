# Exercise 3 - Memory

A computer system uses the **Working Set Page Replacement Algorithm** with a working set window (∆) of 4 page references. The system has a limited physical memory of 4 frames.

## Page Reference String:
The following page reference string is given:

1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4

## Instructions:

* Simulate the Working Set Page Replacement Algorithm using the given page reference string. Track the pages in the working set at each step.
* Determine the number of page faults that occur.
Identify which pages are evicted when the working set changes.
* How does increasing or decreasing the working set window size (∆) affect the number of page faults?
