<Place an [X] for the correct answer>

Which of the following best describes the difference between basic tasks and periodic tasks in a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)?
[ ] Basic tasks run continuously in a loop, while periodic tasks are executed only once during system startup.
[X] Basic tasks are triggered by external interrupts, while periodic tasks are triggered by a timer at regular intervals.
[ ] Basic tasks have higher priority than periodic tasks in all scheduling policies.
[ ] Basic tasks must always be completed before periodic tasks can start.

Which of the following statements about the ELF file format is correct?
[ ] The ELF file format is used only by Windows executables and libraries.
[ ] ELF files contain only source code and are not used during linking or execution.
[X] ELF files are structured into headers, sections, and segments to support linking, loading, and execution.
[ ] An ELF file always contains debugging symbols and high-level language constructs.

What is virtual memory in a computer system?
[ ] A storage area used to store temporary data during program execution.
[ ] A type of memory that is physically installed in the computer hardware.
[X] An abstraction layer that provides each process with its own isolated memory space.
[ ] A technique used to compress data to reduce memory usage.


Question 4

<Place an [X] for the correct answer>

In a real-time OS, which of the following statements about interrupt latency is true?
[ ] Interrupt latency is the time taken to process an interrupt completely.
[X] Interrupt latency is the time taken from when an interrupt is triggered until it starts execution.
[ ] Interrupt latency does not impact system performance.
[ ] Real-time OS does not allow interrupts to be preempted.


Question 5
==========
<Place an [X] for the correct answer>

What is a hard real-time system?
[X] A system where tasks have strict deadlines and missing a deadline can cause system failure
[ ] A system that prioritizes throughput over deadline constraints
[ ] A system where tasks execute as soon as possible, without strict timing guarantees
[ ] A system where the CPU is always fully utilized
