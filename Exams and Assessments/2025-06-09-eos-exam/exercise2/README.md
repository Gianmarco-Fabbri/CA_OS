# Exercise 2 - Scheduling

Consider the following set of hard-real-time periodic tasks :

| Task | Period | WCE (Worst Case Execution) |
|------|--------|-----------------------------|
| P1   | 50     | 25                          |
| P2   | 80     | 35                          |

1. Explaining the conditions required to schedule the tasks
2. Compute if the scheduling is feasible using the EDF algorithm
3. Show how the tasks will be scheduled using a timing diagram with at least two periods for each task.
