What is the main distinction between hard and soft real-time systems?

[ ] Hard real-time systems guarantee the timeliness of tasks, while soft real-time systems allow occasional missed deadlines.
[ ] Hard real-time systems prioritize task order over timing, while soft real-time systems prioritize timing.
[ ] Hard real-time systems require high performance, while soft real-time systems do not.
[ ] Hard real-time systems operate with real hardware, while soft real-time systems operate in a simulated environment.

Which of the following statements about race conditions is true?
[ ] Race conditions always lead to system crashes.
[ ] Race conditions only occur in single-threaded applications.
[ ] Race conditions are difficult to reproduce because the timing of thread execution can vary.
[ ] Race conditions are only a concern in real-time systems.
